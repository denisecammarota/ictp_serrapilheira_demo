# 2022 Scientific Computing Intro

This repository corresponds to the [Introduction to Scientific Computing](https://scientific-computing.netlify.app/) Class of the [2022 ICTP-SAIFR/Serrapilheira program on Quantitative Biology and Ecology](https://www.ictp-saifr.org/qbioprogram/), as taught by Sara Mortara and Andrea Sánchez-Tapia.

## Where to find the Foo package and website 
During the class that dealt with the creation of an R package, we created an example package which can be found on this [repo](https://github.com/denisecammarota/foo-package-R). Also, we built and deployed a [webpage](https://denisecammarota.github.io/foo-package-R/) for our package using github pages.
